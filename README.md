# Advancing Multilingual Fact Checking with LLMs and Data Augmentation Techniques

This project will build upon the X-FACT multilingual dataset and baseline models presented in (Gupta et al., 2021). X-FACT is a large publicly available multilingual dataset for factual verification of real-world claims, spanning 25 typologically diverse languages across 11 language families. The dataset provides a benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual transfer and generalization abilities of multilingual fact-checking systems.
While the original X-FACT paper implemented baseline models using multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), this project aims to extend that work by:
1) Experimenting with newer, more powerful multilingual language models
2) Investigating cross-lingual transfer learning between related languages
3) Augmenting the training data with synthetic examples through translation and paraphrasing
